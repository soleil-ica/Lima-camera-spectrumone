* This class is designed to handle GpibCommss. It's point of

* done with 'goToRemoteMode' device's method. It totaly hides the fact that this
* is done by sending a command to gpib board. Due to ESRF gpib bus usage, this
* class is designed to work on a single CIC (Controler In Charge) bus. In simple
* word this class can't handle multi board buses. The default CIC selected is
* "gpib0".
*
* The usual way to include gpib feature into a Tango device server consists in
* single or multiple instance of a GpibComms / gpibBoard.
* Once simply use read / write functions to handle devices. Note that All 
* operations made on GpibComms or gpibBoard can potentialy throw a 
* GpibCommsException.<link ref ="code example" href "code-example.txt">
